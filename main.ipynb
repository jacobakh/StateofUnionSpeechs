    "In this project, we sought to explore a dataset of Presidential speeches ranging from 1790 to 2017. There are 227 unique speeches delivered by 42 presidents, which mostly consist of the annual State of the Union Address. By building a \"shared vocabulary\" consisting of all of the words used in at least one speech, we compared and contrasted Presidents by the frequency with which they used certain words. We mainly used dimensionality reduction techniques for visualization, and built a k-nearest neighbors classifier for prediction. "
